# Tutorial: 3D-bin-packing

This project provides a Python library for solving the **3D Bin Packing Problem**.
It calculates how to efficiently fit a list of *3D items* (like boxes or cylinders) into one or more *bins* (containers).
The main **Packer Engine** uses a specific *packing algorithm* and considers various *constraints* like item rotation, stability, and weight limits.
It also includes features for *visualization* to show the packed bins and an *API* to use the packing functionality through a web service.
